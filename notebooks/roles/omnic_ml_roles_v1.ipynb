    "## Additional background / hypothesis\n",
    "* Commonly in gaming there is the concept of \"role\" similar to positions in sports\n",
    "* In Valorant, characters are grouped into 4 main roles and their \"kit\" is designed to fill that role\n",
    "    - Controller\n",
    "    - Initiator\n",
    "    - Duelist\n",
    "    - Sentinels\n",
    "* Some characters are a bit fluid (can play multiple roles) but generally the character is a good proxy for role\n",
    "* However the player can ignore the kit/character and still play a different \"role\" even if their character isnt designed for it\n",
    "* There are sub-roles\n",
    "* There is a general idea that in order to have the best chance of winning, you should have a 2 sentinels, 1 initiator, 1 duelist, 1 controller\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis/questions\n",
    "* Is it possible to group players by their gameplay (how different is their gameplay)?\n",
    "    * Idea: we know the different people's ids, if we cluster the data and see how many clusters it forms (DBSCAN?) will it be similar or different to the ammount of people we have?\n",
    "* Is it possible to determine how well a player is playing the role assigned by the character but independent of character?\n",
    "    * Idea: we gather data from the \"best\" professionals in each character role, and treat this as the ground truth for that role\n",
    "        * then we can measure how close a player is playing that role\n",
    "        * could also attempt to classify based on the ground truth\n",
    "* It it possible to prove/disprove the team-comp sentiment?\n",
    "    * Idea: once we have a good idea of what leads to wins/losses, we can add in different character comps and see how that influeces match outcomes? basically try and see if the ratio of characters/roles actually matters\n",
    "* Is it possible to show that certain characters/roles are more important/relevant depending on the STATE of the match (what has happened??)\n",
    "    * Idea: classify/catagorize matches into opening, mid, end game based on events (like chess) to determine strategy, and then see which roles are most effective at progressing the match to the next event.\n",

    "Roles questions:\n",
    "1. If I group the data by characters into the 4 classes (duelist, initiator, controller, sentinel) can I classify the data based on those classes (those are the labels)\n",
    "    1. Ideally I would be able to see which features are driving the classification per class and in total?\n",
    "2. Is it possible to cluster the data?\n",
    "    1. I think features could be less important in the sense that we could observe the grouping and see what roles make sense from the data?\n",
    "    2. We make this the new classes and similarly try to classify"
